            <p>Combining technology, research, and aesthetics is a highly rewarding experience for me. The ability to speak the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has allowed me to bridge the gap between art, design, and science. <strong>When done right, UX design combined with frontend development is itself, an art form.</strong></p>

            <p>With a BFA from Savannah College of Art and Design and vast experience in graphic design and Illustration, I’ve been featured in several design industry publications including 2 Illustrator Bibles. <strong>I’ve also designed hundreds of posters, billboards and marketing campaigns for companies such as Starz, (like HBO).</strong> I’ve had the pleasure of producing work for a wide variety of clients ranging from the Entertainment to the Financial industries and everything in-between.</p>

            <p>I love challenges as I see them as an opportunity to learn and inevitably grow. <strong>The notion that I will continually discover fresh ideas and share them with others within my career is exhilarating.</strong> UX design reflects that mindset as one is faced with continually learning not only about new techniques, technologies, and skills but also about the motivations and struggles of human beings.</p>
