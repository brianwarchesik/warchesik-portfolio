Although there are some currently available, the marketplace is clearly unknown at this time.

                                <p>Open Sans was chosen for the PackMinder brand as it was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in all of its letterforms.</p>
                                <p class="p-secondary">Open Sans also compliments the letter forms within the logo and aids in the general aesthetics of the brand which are <strong>clean, dynamic, and sophisticated</strong>.</p>

                            <p class="p-secondary">While removing the event type scenario solved most of the inherent issues within the flow, it also led to certain problems being unaddressed. Users would still need the application to suggest established items for flight or extensive travels.</p>

                            <p class="p-secondary">Solving this issue required including the Flight button within the activities selection menu. This way, a user could still receive list suggestions for extensive travel such as passports, etc. The Custom button was also re-located to the top of the group. This would help a user always know where to locate it even if other activities shifted.</p>

                            <p>To verify that the changes from the previous prototype were valid, another round of user testing was conducted. This time, however, the testing was short and only focused on the Creating a List flow. All 3 of the participants were shown only the part of the prototype relating to this purpose and were tested in person.</p>

                                    <li>Were no longer confused about which type of event to choose.</li>
                                    <li>Did not have to pause to read information about events.</li>
                                    <li>Were able to complete the task much more quickly and with fewer clicks than within the previous prototype.</li>

                            <p>By supplying a designated application for packing purposes, users can save valuable time and money. By offering suggested items to bring for different circumstances, PackMinder assists its users in diminishing the time and frustrations of coming up with different packing lists for specific scenarios. With the ability to set reminders and track certain items, PackMinder also eliminates the need for users to utilize several applications to achieve their goals.</p>
                            <p>Participants within the user testing phase of the project helped to verify the accomplishments by stating that they would be highly interested in such an application for either themselves or their loved ones.</p>

                            <p>In utilizing an unfamiliar application for development, there is always an inherent learning curve. That was an expectation as Adobe XD was chosen to produce the prototype. However, unexpected issues arose as XD continually was offering updates within the timeframe that the PackMinder application was being designed. While these updates offered desired capabilities, they also threw some major errors into the previously set screens and animations.</p>
                            <p>There is an innate risk in updating development applications in the middle of designing or developing any project. Sometimes, it is more valuable to use an older, more stable version of an app than leaping forward to new and exciting features.</p>
