                    <h2>User Stories</h2>
                    <p>Using the information gathered from the Discovery and Strategy phases, I complied user stories to demonstrate the main features of the application.</p>
                    <p>I prioritized features according to the earlier research &amp; developed personas into high, medium and low priority tasks. There were also three types of user scenarios created for New Users, Returning Users and All Users.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>As a new user, I want to sign up for an account using email.</li>
                        <li>As a new user, I want to choose my tier option for the amount of space I can afford.</li>
                        <li>As a new user, I want payment options for my upgraded tier if applicable.</li>
                        <li>As a user, I want the ability to sync with my  Adobe Creative Cloud Account.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>User Stories were converted into User Flows to demonstrate how the user could interact with the product and accomplish specific tasks. These were first sketched out on paper.</p>
                    <p>Further development and iterations were rendered in the application, Draw.io.</p>

                    <p>After establishing the user stories and flows, I began creating the skeletal structure of the application with pencil and paper to quickly sketch out the rough ideas.</p>
                    <p>These were then transformed into low fidelity digital mock-ups and prototypes using Sketch and InVision for prototyping.</p>

                    <h2>Usability Testing Round 1</h2>
                    <p>Once the prototype was in place, it was time for user testing. 2 of the tests were conducted in-person using an InVision prototype, and 1 was performed remotely using the tool Maze to record the results.</p>

                    <p>Testing Tasks</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a new, free account and secure it with 2-factor authentication.</li>
                        <li>Without using drag and drop, add some files from your computer to your new cloud.</li>
                        <li>Place the file, “dance_in_water.jpg” into the folder, “Inspirational Photos” without using drag &amp; drop.</li>
                        <li>Link your Adobe Creative Cloud to this Cloud Storage application so that you can see all of your files from that cloud as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Testing Conclusions</p>
                    <p>While overall the testing went well, It did bring up some issues that needed rectification. 2 of 3 users had some problem with the <span class="magenta">ellipsis</span> on the folders and files.</p>
                    <p>It was also noted that the <span class="magenta">Share</span> icon and label was not necessary to be included in the top level navigation. Removing it and addressing that function within each file or folder would help reduce the cognitive load on users regarding the dashboard.</p>

                    <p>These problems would be addressed in the high fidelity phase of the project.</p>

                    <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
                    <p>The name SOZO stems from both the Ancient Greek word, meaning; <strong> To Save</strong> or <strong>To Rescue</strong> and the Japanese word, meaning; <strong>Creation</strong> or <strong>To Imagine</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The combination of these two meanings is intended to reflect the characteristics of what the application does. It saves or rescues files and folders from local directories, and allows users to create and organize data from within its space in a creative manner.</p>

                    <p>Although the initial survey indicated that 86&percnt; of participants used a desktop or laptop computer to access their application, along with the desktop version, mobile mockups were created per the client’s request.</p>

                    <p>The final prototype was produced and tested again to find remaining or newly created flaws in the usability of the application. For this round of testing, all three participants were tested in-person.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that all participants completed other tasks and testing for the benefit of the application.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>2 out of 3 participants were curious about the functionality of the “info” button on folders and files within the grid view.</li>
                        <li>The information about files and folders could have increased contrast for accessibility purposes when shown in the list view.</li>

                    <p>By offering users a cloud storage application that links to other storage programs, SOZO grants users a common place to see and use all of their content without the hindrance of signing into multiple platforms. SOZO also offers various security options for files, folders, and accounts granting users the protection they want for their content. Finally, SOZO provides multiple customization options for users allowing them to organize and display their content in whatever way is most optimal for them.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>Although I intended to initially develop a small design system near the beginning of the project to speed up the process, it quickly expanded and at times was more of an obstacle than an aid. That being said, the value of a design system paid off in the end, but I learned that the implementation of such a system should come further along in the process of development.</p>
                    <p>Taking small steps at the beginning and resisting the urge for giant leaps is essential for a product to succeed.</p>

                    <h2>Future Iterations</h2>
                    <p>While the features within the MVP were addressed in this version, the next round of SOZO would include a full prototype of the mobile version, additional functionality showing the ways a user can customize their files and folders, and solutions to notifications for users sharing data.</p>
